# Spacestagram-Website

This website uses NASA's API to access the Astronomy Photo of the Day as well as a photo from 'Curiosity,' its rover on Mars. Using a jQuery CDN to help with JavaScript code, I created an Instagram style page where the user can view the photo, its name, date of capture, a little description of the photo, and like/ unlike the photo by clicking the button. On click, the button turns red, indicating the photo is liked, and it saves whether the photo is liked or unliked whenever the user leaves or refreshes the page.
